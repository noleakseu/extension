# NoLeaks
Audit potential privacy leaks on websites. 

## Description
The extension helps you control potential privacy leaks by auditing external content on every website you visit.
In the pop-up you see all outgoing connections to the external resources. 
You may block some or all of them and prevent the leaks of any data in the future. 
Next time when you visit the website, these blocks will be applied automatically.
Blocked websites are shared with other users to help make the Web great again in terms of GDPR and privacy.
